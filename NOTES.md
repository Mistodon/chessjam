Notes
===

1.  The fact that you can have a `rust-toolchain` file is not well documented.
2.  Mixing stable and nightly isn't fun - neither is using old nightlies.
    -   Feature annotations/lack of feature annotations in particular.
3.  Volume shadows and self shadowing - particularly on curved surfaces - looks very weird.
4.  Automation is a really good idea.
